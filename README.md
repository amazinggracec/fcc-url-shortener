API Basejump: URL Shortener
User stories:
I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
Example creation usage:
https://shurli.herokuapp.com/new/https://www.google.com 
https://shurli.herokuapp.com/new/http://freecodecamp.com/news 
If you want to pass a site that doesn't exist (or an invalid url) for some reason you can do:
https://shurli.herokuapp.com/new/invalid?allow=true
Example creation output:
{ "original_url": "http://freecodecamp.com/news", "short_url": "https://shurli.herokuapp.com/4" }
Usage:
https://shurli.herokuapp.com/4
Will redirect to:
http://freecodecamp.com/news
